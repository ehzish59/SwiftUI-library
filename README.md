# SwiftUI Library

## Overview

SwiftUI Library is a collection of reusable SwiftUI components aimed at simplifying the development of iOS applications. This library includes a variety of components such as a QR Code Reader, Image Picker, and many more, each designed with reusability and ease of integration in mind.

## Features

- **Modular and Reusable Components**: Each component in our library is housed in its own separate folder, complete with all necessary classes, modules, and views. This structure ensures that developers can easily integrate individual components into their projects and fine-tune designs and user experiences to their preferences.

- **Searchable and Organized**: The library features a searchable list, enabling developers to quickly locate the exact component they need. Each component is meticulously categorized and documented, ensuring a seamless integration process.

- **Rich Preview Support**: Experience each component firsthand with SwiftUI's Preview feature. We provide a comprehensive preview setup for each component, allowing developers to see and interact with the components in various states and configurations before integrating them into their projects.
